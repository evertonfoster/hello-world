Storage for practice code
---
I need practice researching and solving problems that are about html or front end coding issues. The problems that I am trying to solve currently are about the
non activation of Javascript when I attempt to use ATOM to create web applications. I've tried running the code with different styles i.e. inline script tag with the JS, script tag in the header with Javascript in a separate file, I've redownloaded ATOM, I'm losing my mind. 

I've come to the conclusion that the only way that I figure this out is to take a nice long swim in the ocean of IT, Comp Sci madness and come out reborn into some kind of computer genius. Or at least someone who can create and run code, and who can recognize when environments will not be conducive to that task. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this (addressing myself in the future). 

Hopefully I gain some insights from earnestly exploring githubs forums.
